# Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Model
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can be used to classify and detect brain tumors in patient's brain MRI images. The model has an accuracy of 84%.

Requirements
To run this model, you will need the following:

Python 3
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV

## Usage

To use the model, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Place your brain MRI images in the `images` directory.
3. Change notebook file as your requirements

Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify and detect brain tumors in new images
